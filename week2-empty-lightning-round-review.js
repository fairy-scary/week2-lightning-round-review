// APP ACADEMY WEEK 2: LIGHTNING ROUND REVIEW - EMPTY


// MONDAY: Running JS Locally Lesson Learning Objectives
// 1. Match the commands ls, cd, pwd to their descriptions

// 2. Given a folder structure diagram, a list of 'cd (path)' commands and target files, match the paths to the target files.

// 3. Use VSCode to create a folder. Within the folder create a .js file containing console.log('hello new world'); and save it.

// 4. Use node to execute a JavaScript file in the terminal

// MONDAY: Advanced Array Methods

// TUESDAY: Plain Old JS Object Lesson Learning Objectives
// 1. Identify when to use . vs [] when accessing values of an object
    
// 2. Use the obj[key] !== undefined pattern to check if a given variable that contains a key exists in an object

// 3. Utilize Object.keys and Object.values in a function

// 4. Iterate through an object using a for...in loop

// 5. Define a function that utilizes ...rest syntax to accept an arbitrary number of arguments

// 6. Use ...spread syntax for Object literals and Array literals
    
// 7. Destructure an array to reference specific elements
    
// 8. Destructure an object to reference specific values
   
// 9. Write a function that accepts an array as an argument and returns an object representing the count of each character in the array

// 10. Label variables as either Primitive vs. Reference


// WEDNESDAY: Callbacks Lesson Learning Objectives
// 1. Given multiple plausible reasons, identify why functions are called “First Class Objects” in JavaScript.
  
// 2. Given a code snippet containing an anonymous callback, a named callback, and multiple console.logs, predict what will be printed

// 3. Write a function that takes in a value and two callbacks. The function should return the result of the callback that is greater.

// 4. Write a function, myMap, that takes in an array and a callback as arguments. The function should mimic the behavior of Array.map.

// 5. Write a function, myFilter, that takes in an array and a callback as arguments. The function should mimic the behavior of Array.filter.

// 6. Write a function, myEvery, that takes in an array and a callback as arguments. The function should mimic the behavior of Array.every.


// THURSDAY: Scope Lesson Learning Objectives
// 1. Identify the difference between const, let, and var declarations

// 2. Explain the difference between const, let, and var declarations

// 3. Predict the evaluation of code that utilizes function scope, block scope, lexical scope, and scope chaining

// 4. Define an arrow function

// 5. Implement a closure and explain how the closure effects scope
